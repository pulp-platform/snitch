# Snitch System

This monolithic repository hosts software and hardware for the Snitch generator and generated systems.

## Getting Started

To get started, check out the [getting started guide](https://pulp-platform.github.io/snitch/ug/getting_started/).

## Content

What can you expect to find in this repository?

- The [Snitch integer core](https://pulp-platform.github.io/snitch/rm/snitch/). This can be useful stand-alone if you are just
  interested in re-using the core for your project, e.g., as a tiny control core
  or you want to make a peripheral smart. The sky is the limit.
- The [Snitch cluster](https://pulp-platform.github.io/snitch/ug/snitch_cluster/). A highly configurable cluster containing one to many
  integer cores with optional floating-point capabilities as well as our custom
  ISA extensions `Xssr`, `Xfrep`, and `Xdma`.
- Any other system that is based on Snitch compute elements. Right now, we do not
  have any open-sourced yet, but be sure that this is going to change.
