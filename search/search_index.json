Applications\n\nThis subdirectory contains some applications or benchmarks specifically implemented and optimized for Snitch.\n\n## Contents\n- Data generation:\n    - `data_gen.py`: script to generate data and expected results for various benchmarks\n    - `data`: output folder of `data_gen.py` which also contains the configuration to generate the data\n- `src`:\n    - `kernels`: basic kernels, currently contains `GEMM`, `BatchNorm`, `Maxpool`, `Fusedconv`\n- `layers`: wraps the kernel to form a DNN layer. Manages data-movement, synchronization, double buffering etc.\n    - `utils`: some helpful functions for benchmarking, verification, fast `memset`\n- `net_layer.c`: various ready tests to run layers.\n- `include`: includes `layer` struct.\n\n## SW Testbenches\nThere are currently a few tests for various layer types. Some additional information about these tests is given below:\n- `net_maxpool.c`: Naive implementation of a maxpooling layer, not optimized in any way due to memory-boundness\n- `net-batchnorm.c`: Implementation of a batchnorm layer with SSR streams (both read and write)\n- `net-conv2d.c`: Implementation and tiling of a 2D convolution that can be distributed to multiple clusters. The convolution is implemented as an `im2col` transformation (performed by 2D DMA transfers) + optimized GEMM. The memory layout of input and output feature map is Height x Width x Channels. The convolution is globally parallelized over output channels. Inside a cluster, the output pixels are distributed among the cores. There is an option to load the feature map from a different cluster instead of the main memory by setting `cluster2cluster` in the layer struct to `1`. Currently only `fp64` is implemented, but the data movement for `fp32` or lower precision SIMD should be analogously.\n- `net-gemm.c`: Testbench to benchmark the optimized GEMM implementation for different memory layouts, dimensions and precisions.\n- `net-fusedconv.c`: Implementation of a fused kernel with Conv2d + BatchNorm + ReLU. The interface of the kernel is compatible with DORY. Parameters of a tile can be specified in `data/fusedconv_param.hjson`. Supported paramters are input/output dimension, padding, kernel dimension &amp; stride, flags for BatchNorm and ReLU. Further there are two additional specialized kernels 1) a CHW kernel for input layers with very few input channels, the output of this kernel is in the HWC layout again 2) A depthwise kernel\n\n## Usage\nTo run a specific benchmark, first configure the dimensions and the desired precision `data/app_params.hjson`.\n</code></pre> {     kernel: \"GEMM\"     M: 16,     N: 16,     K: 16,     alpha: 0,     transpose_A: false,     transpose_B: true,     prec: 16 } <pre><code>The file will be automatically generated with a `cmake` macro and is stored in `data/data_app.h`. The result will also be checked. Reference is a golden model written in `python` with help of the `torch`.\n\nThe applications are compiled into a folder which can be enabled by adding `add_subdirectory(${SNITCH_SOFTWARE_DIR}/applications` to `CMakeLists.txt` in the specific `sw` folder.\n\n## Requirements\n- `torch`\n</code></pre></p> <p>Updated on 2023-06-19 at 09:43:56 +0000</p>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/","title":"snRuntime/src/alloc.h","text":""},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#functions","title":"Functions","text":"Name snrt_allocator_t * snrt_l1_allocator() snrt_allocator_t * snrt_l3_allocator() void * snrt_l1_next() void * snrt_l3_next() void * snrt_l1alloc(size_t size)Allocate a chunk of memory in the L1 memory. void snrt_l1_update_next(void * next)Override the L1 allocator next pointer. void * snrt_l3alloc(size_t size)Allocate a chunk of memory in the L3 memory. void snrt_alloc_init() void * snrt_memset(void * ptr, int value, size_t num)"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#attributes","title":"Attributes","text":"Name snrt_allocator_t l3_allocator"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#defines","title":"Defines","text":"Name ALIGN_UP(addr, size) ALIGN_DOWN(addr, size) MIN_CHUNK_SIZE"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#functions-documentation","title":"Functions Documentation","text":""},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#function-snrt_l1_allocator","title":"function snrt_l1_allocator","text":"<pre><code>inline snrt_allocator_t * snrt_l1_allocator()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#function-snrt_l3_allocator","title":"function snrt_l3_allocator","text":"<pre><code>inline snrt_allocator_t * snrt_l3_allocator()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#function-snrt_l1_next","title":"function snrt_l1_next","text":"<pre><code>inline void * snrt_l1_next()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#function-snrt_l3_next","title":"function snrt_l3_next","text":"<pre><code>inline void * snrt_l3_next()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#function-snrt_l1alloc","title":"function snrt_l1alloc","text":"<pre><code>inline void * snrt_l1alloc(\nsize_t size\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Allocate a chunk of memory in the L1 memory. </p> <p>Parameters: </p> <ul> <li>size number of bytes to allocate </li> </ul> <p>Return: pointer to the allocated memory </p> <p>This currently does not support free-ing of memory</p>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#function-snrt_l1_update_next","title":"function snrt_l1_update_next","text":"<pre><code>inline void snrt_l1_update_next(\nvoid * next\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Override the L1 allocator next pointer. </p>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#function-snrt_l3alloc","title":"function snrt_l3alloc","text":"<pre><code>inline void * snrt_l3alloc(\nsize_t size\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Allocate a chunk of memory in the L3 memory. </p> <p>Parameters: </p> <ul> <li>size number of bytes to allocate </li> </ul> <p>Return: pointer to the allocated memory </p> <p>This currently does not support free-ing of memory</p>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#function-snrt_alloc_init","title":"function snrt_alloc_init","text":"<pre><code>inline void snrt_alloc_init()\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#function-snrt_memset","title":"function snrt_memset","text":"<pre><code>inline void * snrt_memset(\nvoid * ptr,\nint value,\nsize_t num\n)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#attributes-documentation","title":"Attributes Documentation","text":""},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#variable-l3_allocator","title":"variable l3_allocator","text":"<pre><code>snrt_allocator_t l3_allocator;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#macros-documentation","title":"Macros Documentation","text":""},{"location":"runtime/Files/alloc_8h/#define-align_up","title":"define ALIGN_UP","text":"<pre><code>#define ALIGN_UP(\naddr,\nsize\n)\n(((addr) + (size)-1) &amp;

The convolution is implemented as an <code>im2col</code> transformation (performed by 2D DMA transfers) + optimized GEMM. The memory layout of input and output feature map is Height x Width x Channels. The convolution is globally parallelized over output channels. Inside a cluster, the output pixels are distributed among the cores. There is an option to load the feature map from a different cluster instead of the main memory by setting <code>cluster2cluster</code> in the layer struct to <code>1</code>.

Supported paramters are input/output dimension, padding, kernel dimension &amp; stride, flags for BatchNorm and ReLU.
