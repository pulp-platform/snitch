# HerOccamy

## Generating the Bitstream

To create the bitstream for Occamy on the VCU128, you currently need to follow three steps.

### Start by compiling HERO

The hero repository contains the GCC toolchain (to build the kernel) and the LLVM toolchain (for applications).

You need to compile these first as the bootrom requires `uboot-spl` from hero.
Furthermore, the flash will require `uboot` from hero too.

Goto [https://github.com/pulp-platform/hero/tree/tmp/hero_occamy_wip]

### Reducing Occamy's Size

First, the default configuration of Occamy is too large for the VCU128. Therefore, open `hw/system/occamy/src/occamy_cfg.hjson`, and reduce `nr_s1_quadrant` and `nr_clusters` (both to `1`). To make the changes effective in the RTL, navigate to `hw/system/occamy` and run the following command:

```
make update-sources
```

### Compiling the bootrom

To compile the bootrom you will need a riscv64 toolchain as well as u-boot pre-compiled.
First goto `bootrom/Makefile` and modify the toolchain toolchain with : `CROSS_COMPILE ?= riscv64-hero-linux-gnu-`
Now add the hero toolchain to your PATH and compile the bootrom after setting the path to `u-boot-spl` :
```bash
cd bootrom
export HERO_INSTALL=<path_to_your_hero_repository>/install
export PATH=$HERO_INSTALL/share:$HERO_INSTALL/bin:$PATH
export UBOOT_SPL_BIN=<path_to_your_hero_repository>/output/br-hrv-occamy/images/u-boot-spl.bin
make all
```

### Compiling Occamy

To compile Occamy for the VCU128, run the following command from this directory:

__Attention:__ By default use EXT_JTAG=0, if you have the correct FMC debug card you can use EXT_JTAG=1, or set up your own GPIO for JTAG. 
```
make occamy_vcu128 [EXT_JTAG=1] [DEBUG=1]
```
The DEBUG option instanciates ILAs to follow waveform of selected signals in the RTL with (* mark_debug = "true" *).

The EXT_JTAG option redirects the debug module's JTAG signals to GPIOs to be used externally. This way it is possible to use both Vivado ILAs and CVA6 debug module simultaneously. If you have EXT_JTAG=0 you will need to kill vivado hw_server before starting openOCD.

This was tested with VCU128 and a FMC XM105 Debug Card (used to add GPIOs) with a Digilent JTAG HS2 USB Dongle (used to add a JTAG chain on these GPIOs, to connect to the debug module), see the related connections on `occamy_vcu128_impl_ext_jtag.xdc`.

At IIS Vivado HW server is located on the bordcomputer :
```
ssh bordcomputer
/home/vcu128-02/hw_server.sh
```

First flash u-boot in the SPI (this erases the design) :
```bash
# Edit your own fpga infos in Makefile
export UBOOT_ITB=<path_to_your_hero_repository>/output/br-hrv-occamy/images/u-boot.itb
make flash-u-boot VCU=02
```

Open `occamy_vcu128/occamy_vcu128.xpr` in your Vivado client and program the FPGA. Then, still in Vivado, overwrite the bootrom by sourcing `bootrom/bootrom-spl.tcl` (__Attention:__ After writing the bootrom you need to reset the board, in the GUI open hw_vio_1 and set \*_rst_\* signals to 0). You should see the first prints over the UART.

__Infos:__ You can also do everything (flash + programm + bootrom) in command line without opening Vivado client (`make flash-run`). But note that GUI Vivado is smoother, this script might bug in which case you need kill and restart the hw_server before retrying.

```bash
# Edit your own fpga infos in occamy_vcu128_procs.tcl
export UBOOT_ITB=path_to_your_hero_repository/output/br-hrv-occamy/images/u-boot.itb
make program VCU=02
```

### OpenOCD

You can later use OpenOCD to debug CVA6.

```bash
# Without EXT_JTAG
openocd -f openocd_configs/vcu128-2.cfg 
# With    EXT_JTAG
openocd -f openocd_configs/digilent-HS2.cfg 
# If needed modify the ftdi parameters in the openocd config accordingly to your device

riscv64-hero-linux-gnu-gdb -ex "target extended-remote :3334"
```

We recommend waiting for the boot to be done before starting openocd, if you need to test connectivity to your debug module you can as well set BOOTMODE to JTAG in `bootrom/src/main.c` before re-programming the bootrom (see previous section).

At this point the boot should start. Make sure that your kernel is present on the tfpt server (see HERO readme).

## Generating the Bitstream

To create the bitstream for Occamy on the VCU128, you currently need to follow two steps.


### Reducing Occamy's Size

First, the default configuration of Occamy (4k cores) is too large for the VCU128. Therefore, open `hw/system/occamy/src/occamy_cfg.hjson`, and reduce `nr_s1_quadrant` and `nr_clusters` (e.g. both to `1`). To make the changes effective, navigate to `hw/system/occamy` and run the following command:

```
make update-sources
```


### Compiling Occamy

To compile Occamy for the VCU128, run the following command from this directory:

```
make occamy_vcu128
```

## Running Linux

This is the current boot flow for Linux on Occamy:

1. All cores start fetching from ROM. The worker cores (Snitches) are parked, whereas the manager core (Ariane) starts loading U-Boot SPL from ROM into DRAM, passes the hart-ID and device tree pointer and jumps to the U-Boot SPL start address in DRAM.

2. U-Boot SPL initialises the VCU128's flash, and loads the image containing OpenSBI + U-Boot into DRAM.

3. OpenSBI sets up the M-mode environment and drops to U-Boot in S-mode.

4. U-Boot loads the Linux image from the SPI flash into DRAM, decompresses and boots it.


### Compiling Linux and U-Boot

First, we need to compile the required SW binaries and images, including Linux, OpenSBI and U-Boot. For that, navigate to a suitable location, clone and build the `occamy` branch of [CVA6 SDK](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6-sdk/tree/occamy) as follows:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:openhwgroup/cva6-sdk.git
cd cva6-sdk
git checkout occamy
make u-boot/u-boot.itb
make uImage
```
`u-boot.itb` ist the image containing OpenSBI + U-Boot, `uImage` is the Linux image in U-Boot format.


### Preparing the VCU128's Flash

Next, we need to load the required images into the VCU128's SPI flash. `u-boot.itb` i   s expected at address `0x6000000` of the flash, `uImage` at `0x6100000`.

For flashing, we provide an example Vivado script (`occamy_vcu128_flash.tcl`). At IIS, after starting `hw_server` on bordcomputer, you can use the following `make` targets to load the images to the appropriate location in flash:

```
export CVA6_SDK=path/to/cva6-sdk
export RISCV=$CVA6_SDK/install
export PATH=$PATH:$RISCV/bin
make flash-u-boot VCU=[01|02] CVA6_SDK=path/to/cva6-sdk
make flash-uimage VCU=[01|02] CVA6_SDK=path/to/cva6-sdk
```

`VCU` specifies which VCU128 we want to target (`vcu-01` or `vcu-02`, default `01`). `CVA6_SDK` defaults to `path/to/snitch/../cva6-sdk`.


### Programming the FPGA

Finally, we can program the FPGA with the bitstream generated earlier. At IIS, this can be done with the following `make` command:

```
make program VCU=[01|02]
```

Linux should now boot in the sequence described above.
