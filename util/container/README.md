# Docker Container

Docker container based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS containing various hardware and
software development tools for Snitch.

## Pre-built Container

There is an experimental version of the container available. To download, run:

```shell
$ docker pull ghcr.io/pulp-platform/snitch
```

## Using the Container

To run container in interactive mode:

```shell
$ docker run -it -v $REPO_TOP:/repo -w /repo ghcr.io/pulp-platform/snitch
```

## Local Build Instructions

In case you do not want to use the pre-built container you can also build the
container in local mode:

```shell
$ cd $REPO_TOP
$ sudo docker build -t ghcr.io/pulp-platform/snitch -f util/container/Dockerfile .
```

## Limitations

Some operations require more memory than the default Docker VM might provide by
default (2 GB on OS X for example). *We recommend at least 16 GB of memory.*

The memory resources can be adjusted in the Docker daemon's settings.

> The swap space is limited to 4 GB in OS X default VM image. It doesn't seem as
> this is enough for using `verilator`, `cc` keeps crashing because it runs out
> of swap space (at least that is what `dmesg` tells us). Also 8 GB of swap
> space don't seem to be enough.

> swapon -v /var/lib/swap
